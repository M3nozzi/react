## :rocket: About the challenge
The challenge is to continue to develop the application that will store the portfolio repositories, which you already developed the backend in the last challenge using Node.js.

### Technologies

### Application features

- **`List the repositories from API`** Should be able to create a list with the title field of all the repositories that are registered in the API.

- **`Add a repository to API`** Should be able to add a new item to the API using a button with the text Add and, after creation, you should be able to display its name after registration.

- **`Remove a repository from API`** For each item on the list, must have a button with the text Remove which, when clicked, will call a function to remove that item from the list of the frontend and the API.
